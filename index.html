         <p>Welcome to your new job as a Whataburger Employee!</p>
         <p>As a new employee, I know how overwhelming everything feels. There seems to be endless responsibilites and tasks that
            people expect of you. Of course, you can always ask your senior coworkers for help, <i>and I encourage you to do so</i>.
            However, this website was created for you to have a comfy guide to refer to whenever you need it!
